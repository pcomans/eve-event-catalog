# Known Issues

Sharp edges discovered while building on eve 0.22.5 (beta). Read this before touching channel
code or running a demo.

## 1. Channel event handlers can silently stop firing after a hot reload

eve re-resolves channel `events` handlers from a registry keyed by channel "kind" on every
workflow step — handler functions are not carried by reference across steps. After a hot reload,
a session started *before* the edit can look its handlers up against the rebuilt registry and
miss: eve's internal `callAdapterEventHandler` is a **silent no-op** on a missing/mismatched
entry. No error, no log line. For us this means arm-on-turn-complete (`turn.completed` →
`pending → armed`) simply doesn't happen for pre-edit sessions.

- **For development**: after touching channel code, restart the dev server and use a fresh
  conversation id. Never trust behavior of a session that predates your latest edit.
- **For the demo**: not a risk, as long as nothing is edited and `.env.local` isn't touched
  mid-demo — both reload triggers are things you control.
- **Worth knowing**: it's arguably an eve bug (a silent no-op on handler resolution failure is
  hostile to debugging), and it's beta software. If you ever talk to the eve team, this plus the
  broken `getEventStream` docs example (issue 3) are two concrete pieces of feedback from this
  project.

## 2. Any `.env.local` write triggers a hot reload that wipes in-process state

`eve dev` watches env files (documented in eve's CLI reference). A reload drops all in-process
module state — live websocket connections, timers, anything not in Redis — and orphans sessions
mid-turn ("Unhandled queue" log spam). Corollaries:

- Never run `vercel env pull` while the dev server is up.
- `vercel env pull` **overwrites** `.env.local` wholesale — it only writes what's stored in
  Vercel's project env store. All secrets are stored there now (as of 2026-07-11), so pulls are
  safe, but any var added only to the local file will be lost on the next pull.
- `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` expires after ~12h; refresh with `vercel env pull` (server down) **before**
  a demo or test session, never during one.

## 3. eve's custom-channel docs example for streaming is broken

`session.getEventStream()` returns a `ReadableStream` of JS objects, not bytes. Passing it
directly to `new Response(...)` — exactly what eve's `docs/channels/custom.mdx` shows — kills the
connection with an opaque ECONNRESET. The fix (copied from eve's own built-in channel source) is
bridging through a TransformStream that does `JSON.stringify(event) + "\n"` via `TextEncoder`.
See `agent/channels/catalog.ts`.

## 4. `channel.continuationToken` arrives prefixed

In channel event handlers, `channel.continuationToken` is the fully-qualified token
(`"catalog:demo-1"`), not the raw conversation id passed to `send()` — the framework prepends the
channel name. Strip the prefix before registry lookups. The docs mention token namespacing but
never show it landing on this field.

## 5. `vercel integration add` installs agent skills as a side effect

Provisioning the Upstash Marketplace integration auto-installed Upstash reference-doc skills into
`agent/skills/` + `skills-lock.json`, silently expanding the agent's own context surface. Removed
(2026-07-11, user-approved). If another integration is ever added, check `git status` for
unrequested `agent/` changes afterwards.

## 6. LangSmith exporter is a silent no-op without `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true`

`LangSmithOTLPTraceExporter` checks `isEnvTracingEnabled()` per export batch; if
`LANGSMITH_TRACING` (or `LANGSMITH_TRACING_V2`) isn't `"true"`, it drops all spans while
reporting success to the OTel pipeline — no error, no log. The var is provisioned in Vercel's
env store (development) as of 2026-07-11, so `vercel env pull` includes it; if traces ever stop
appearing, check this var first.

## 7. A wake POSTed from inside `turn.completed` races session parking — and eve handles it correctly

`emitTurnEpilogue` (eve's compiled `harness/emission.js`) awaits the `turn.completed` emit — which
drives our channel event handler to completion — *before* emitting `session.waiting`. So a
`provider.arm()` that calls `deliverWake()` synchronously sends its loopback `POST /catalog/wake`
(→ `send()` on the same continuation token) while the session hasn't technically parked yet.

Verified experimentally (`catalog/wake.ts`'s `armPendingForConversation` doc comment has the
detail): a throwaway provider whose `arm()` called `deliverWake()` with zero delay — worse than any
real provider, which needs at least a network round trip to detect a tick — still landed the wake
as the correctly-ordered next turn on the *same* session. eve's local dev (`world-local`) backend
buffers the reentrant `send()` rather than falling back to a new session. No extra defer/scheduling
machinery was added; the existing session-id-mismatch check in the wake route stays as an automatic
backstop in case this behaves differently against a different workflow backend (e.g. in production).

## 8. corepack silently upgraded pnpm mid-session; pnpm 11 rejects fresh packages

Observed 2026-07-12: corepack drifted pnpm from 10.32.1 to 11.12.0 without any action on our
part. pnpm 11 enforces a default `minimumReleaseAge` supply-chain policy that rejects packages
published within the last day — which breaks installs here because eve's beta dependency tree
routinely contains day-old transitive packages (crossws/nf3/srvx at the time). A failed install
can leave the shared `node_modules` broken mid-operation (we lost `node_modules/.bin/eve` and
both running dev servers this way).

- `package.json`'s `packageManager` field pins the exact pnpm version — corepack then stops
  drifting. Pinned to the session's known-good 10.32.1; revisit after the POC (pnpm 11's policy
  is a *good* security feature — the right long-term move is adopting it deliberately, not
  bypassing it).
- If an install still fails with a `minimumReleaseAge` error, run
  `corepack pnpm@10.32.1 <cmd>`. Do NOT reach for `--no-verify-store-integrity` — that disables
  a real security check.
- Never run pnpm with `CI=true` to skip its confirmation prompts — the prompt you're bypassing
  may be "recreate node_modules?", which is destructive to every process using it.

## 9. TS parameter properties break `node --test`

Node's native type-stripping (used by `node --test` / `pnpm test`) cannot parse TypeScript
parameter properties (`constructor(private readonly x: T) {}`) — any test that transitively
imports a file using one fails, and the failure looks like a broken test, not a syntax
limitation. Write explicit field declarations + constructor assignment instead.

## 10. `@alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api` is pinned to a pre-1.0 alpha, by explicit decision

Pinned to `4.0.0-alpha.3` (2026-07-12), exact version, no `^`. This is a deliberate call, not an
oversight:

- The stable `3.x` line is aging and pulls in CVE-bearing transitive dependencies; `4.x` is
  Alpaca's actively-developed ground-up TypeScript rewrite (native `fetch`, typed errors,
  built-in retry/rate-limiting, ergonomic order builders, unified `trading`/`marketData`
  namespaces) — see [PR #295](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-js/pull/295).
  Published 5 days before this decision; the wider PR/alpha effort is ~11 days old.
- The alpha is **absent from Alpaca's docs site** as of this date — the README on the `ts-alpha`
  branch is the only canonical reference; the published docs site still describes `3.x`.
- **Root-export surprise**: most of the SDK's own README examples import types (`Order`,
  `StockDataStream`, `TradeUpdate`, `toStockTrade`, `STATE`, ...) as if they were top-level
  exports. They are not — `dist/index.d.ts` only re-exports the common-case surface (the `Alpaca`
  client, error classes, chart helpers). Everything else lives under namespace exports:
  `trading.Order`, `streaming.{StockDataStream,TradingStream,StreamTrade,TradeUpdate,STATE}`,
  `marketDataShapes.toStockTrade`. `tsc` catches the mismatch immediately (`has no exported
  member`) — if this happens, check the namespace, not the package version.
- A [migration codemod](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-js/blob/ts-alpha/codemods/alpaca-v3-to-v4.js)
  exists for `3.x -> 4.x` when the stable release ships — revisit this pin then. Until stable,
  breaking changes between alpha patch versions are possible; re-verify `pnpm test` +
  `pnpm typecheck` after any alpha version bump.

## 11. Assorted

- The dev server listens on port **2000**, not 3000 as eve's own docs curl examples suggest.
- Local durable workflow state lives in `.workflow-data/` (gitignored). If sessions look stuck
  after crashes/reload incidents, stopping the server and deleting it gives a clean slate —
  active subscriptions in Redis survive, but their parked sessions do not; re-subscribe.
- Live IEX market data only flows during US market hours (9:30–16:00 ET, Mon–Fri). Off-hours,
  price subscriptions arm but never fire, and notional market orders won't fill.
- `POST /catalog/wake` is unauthenticated, consistent with this POC's local-only,
  no-cross-instance-auth scope (see #7's cross-instance dedup note). This means the `guidance`
  field a real wake carries (AGENTS.md rule 4) could in principle be spoofed by anyone who can
  reach the route directly, not just by `wake.ts`'s own internal caller — the same is already
  true of `payload`/`subscribedAt`/`firedAt`. Hardening this route (e.g. a shared secret) is a
  separate, out-of-scope concern for the demo, not something this rule's design fixes.
